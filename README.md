## Project Overview & Goal 

This project aims to analyze the career trajectories of two viral artists,  Tyla Laura Seethal and Paul Russell, by examining their streaming and social media activities from 2022 to 2024. Utilizing data provided by Chartmetric, we aim to uncover patterns and correlations that highlight the impact of these activities on their overall music career success. Both artists experienced significant boosts in their careers due to viral hits and have since released additional hits. Our goal is to determine whether these artists are on the path to long-term success or if they risk being "one-hit wonders."



## Detailed Project Description 

### Background
Tyla and Paul Russell are two artists who gained significant popularity due to viral hits. This project seeks to understand the impact of their streaming and social media presence on their overall career success, particularly after the release of their follow-up hits.

### Motivation
The digital music landscape is constantly evolving, and understanding how various factors contribute to an artist's success can provide valuable insights for artists, record labels, and marketers.



## Data Sources 

Chartmetric API Documentation: API Docs https://api.chartmetric.com/apidoc (remember to create a link here)


## Methodology
* Correlation Analysis: To determine the relationship between streaming numbers and chart performance.
* Sentiment Analysis: To gauge public sentiment towards the artists' music on social media.
* Data Visualization: Using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create informative charts and graphs.


## Results Summary

### Tyla

**Increase in Instagram Followers**
In September 2023, Tyla experienced a significant increase in Instagram followers following the release of her hit song "Water." The number of followers spiked again in May 2024.

**March 2024 Events**
In March 2024, Tyla announced the cancellation of the North American leg of her tour and the postponement of the European leg, citing an injury that had worsened over time.

### Paul Russel

**Inflection Point and Pre-Release Strategy**
* An inflection point in streaming and social media engagement occurs shortly before the song is released. This spike is likely due to pre-release promotional activities.
* The artist shared his song on TikTok prior to its official release, leveraging the platform's viral potential to boost early engagement and create anticipation.

**Post-Q1 2024 Plateau**
After Q1 2024, there is a noticeable plateau in engagement across all platforms. This suggests that while the initial momentum from the release drives significant engagement, sustaining that momentum over the long term proves challenging.

**CPP Rank Stability**
According to the CPP Rank, the artist's ranking remains steady after the viral hit, with only a slight decrease observed in May 2024. This indicates that while the viral success helped maintain a higher baseline of popularity, the initial peak was not fully sustained.

2. Investigating the impact of different types of social media engagement.
