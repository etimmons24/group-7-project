## Project Overview & Goal 

This project aims to analyze the career trajectories of three artists: Tyla Laura Seethal, Paul Russell, and Lisa Loeb, by examining their streaming and social media activities from 2022 to 2024. Utilizing data provided by Chartmetric, we seek to uncover patterns and correlations that highlight the impact of these activities on their overall music career success. Tyla and Paul have experienced significant boosts in their careers due to viral hits and have continued to release successful tracks, while Lisa Loeb offers a contrasting perspective with a career that predates social media yet remains dynamic through her use of new platforms and entrepreneurial endeavors. Our goal is to assess whether these newer artists are on the path to long-term success or are they at risk of becoming "one-hit wonders" based on how their streaming and social media performance have changed since their initial viral hits.

## Detailed Project Description 

### Background
Tyla and Paul Russell are two artists who gained significant popularity due to viral hits. This project seeks to understand the impact of their streaming and social media presence on their overall career success, particularly after the release of their follow-up hits. Lisa Loeb is a veteran artist that had a viral hit pre-social media and successfully leverages social media and entreprenurial ventures outside of music to have a long-term sustainable career in music.

By comparing the performance of these artists' careers to an artist like Lisa Loeb and others typically considered "one-hit wonders," we concluded that:

#### Adaptation and Diversification: 
Lisa Loeb's ability to adapt to the digital era and diversify her career through multiple avenues, such as childrenâ€™s music and her eyewear line, showcases a blueprint for maintaining relevance beyond a single hit. This contrasts with newer artists who may initially flourish on platforms like TikTok but need strategic planning to sustain their careers long-term.

#### Engagement and Innovation: 
Both Tyla and Paul have leveraged their initial viral successes to establish a more consistent presence in the music industry. Their continued engagement with fans through social media and innovative approaches to music releases highlight how modern artists can maintain momentum and avoid the "one-hit wonder" stigma.

#### Metrics and Insights: 
The use of Chartmetric to analyze streaming and social media metrics provides crucial insights into how each artist's strategies align with audience engagement trends. This data-driven approach helps predict potential long-term success and identifies areas where adjustments may enhance career longevity.

In conclusion, our analysis suggests that while viral hits provide a significant boost, the ability to adapt and innovate, coupled with strategic use of analytics, is vital for artists aiming for sustained success in the ever-evolving music industry.

### Motivation
The digital music landscape is constantly evolving, and understanding how various factors contribute to an artist's success can provide valuable insights for artists, record labels, and marketers.

## Data Sources 

Chartmetric API Documentation: API Docs https://api.chartmetric.com/apidoc


## Methodology
* Correlation Analysis: To determine the relationship between streaming numbers and chart performance.
* Sentiment Analysis: To gauge public sentiment towards the artists' music on social media.
* Data Visualization: Using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create informative charts and graphs.


## Results Summary

### Tyla

**Increase in Instagram Followers**
In September 2023, Tyla experienced a significant increase in Instagram followers following the release of her hit song "Water." The number of followers spiked again in May 2024.

**March 2024 Events**
In March 2024, Tyla announced the cancellation of the North American leg of her tour and the postponement of the European leg, citing an injury that had worsened over time.

### Paul Russel

**Inflection Point and Pre-Release Strategy**
* An inflection point in streaming and social media engagement occurs shortly before the song is released. This spike is likely due to pre-release promotional activities.
* The artist shared his song on TikTok prior to its official release, leveraging the platform's viral potential to boost early engagement and create anticipation.

**Post-Q1 2024 Plateau**
After Q1 2024, there is a noticeable plateau in engagement across all platforms. This suggests that while the initial momentum from the release drives significant engagement, sustaining that momentum over the long term proves challenging.

**CPP Rank Stability**
According to the CPP Rank, the artist's ranking remains steady after the viral hit, with only a slight decrease observed in May 2024. This indicates that while the viral success helped maintain a higher baseline of popularity, the initial peak was not fully sustained.

### Lisa Loeb:

**Career Longevity and Adaptation:** Lisa Loeb has continually adapted her music style and explored new genres and platforms, maintaining relevance and engagement in an industry transformed by digital media. Her sustained presence and exploration exemplify the importance of adaptability for long-term career success in the music industry.
